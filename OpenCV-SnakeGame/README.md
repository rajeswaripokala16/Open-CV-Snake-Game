**Created by Tuba Khan**

A classic Nokia Snake game controlled by hand gestures via webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Experience the nostalgia of Nokia Snake with modern AI-powered gesture recognition!

## Features

### üéÆ Classic Nokia Snake Game
- **Authentic Nokia-style graphics** with green monochrome theme
- **Grid-based movement** with rectangular snake segments
- **Growing snake** mechanics - snake grows when eating fruit
- **Collision detection** - game ends when hitting walls or self
- **Score tracking** - earn points by eating fruit
- **Smooth animations** with particle effects

### üëã Hand Gesture Controls
- **MediaPipe hand tracking** for real-time gesture recognition
- **Swipe gestures** - move hand up/down/left/right to control snake direction
- **Pinch gesture** - bring thumb and index finger together for speed boost
- **Face detection** - shows your face in the gesture window
- **Visual feedback** - see hand landmarks and current direction

### ü™ü Dual Window Interface
- **Game Window** - Classic Nokia Snake gameplay
- **Gesture Window** - Live webcam feed with hand tracking visualization

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the setup script to automatically install all required packages:
```bash
python setup.py
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Game
```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Webcam** (built-in or external)
- **Required packages:**
  - opencv-python >= 4.8.0
  - mediapipe >= 0.10.0
  - numpy >= 1.24.0
  - pygame >= 2.4.0

## Controls

### Hand Gestures
| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Swipe Up** | Move snake up |
| **Swipe Down** | Move snake down |
| **Swipe Left** | Move snake left |
| **Swipe Right** | Move snake right |
| **Pinch** (thumb + index) | Speed boost |

### Game Controls
- **ESC** - Quit game
- **Show UP gesture** when game over - Restart game
- **Q** in gesture window - Quit

## Game Mechanics

### Snake Behavior
- Snake moves continuously in the current direction
- Cannot move directly backward (prevents instant death)
- Speed increases when pinch gesture is detected
- Snake grows by one segment when eating fruit

### Scoring
- **+10 points** per fruit eaten
- Score displayed in top-left corner
- Final score shown on game over screen

### Game Over Conditions
- Snake hits the wall boundaries
- Snake collides with its own body
- Show UP gesture to restart

## Technical Details

### Game Engine
- **Pygame** for game graphics and window management
- **Grid-based movement** (20x20 pixel grid cells)
- **60 FPS** display refresh rate
- **Variable game speed** (8-15 FPS based on difficulty)

### Computer Vision
- **MediaPipe Hands** for hand landmark detection
- **MediaPipe Face Detection** for face tracking
- **OpenCV** for video capture and processing
- **Real-time gesture analysis** with movement thresholds

### Architecture
- **Threaded design** - game and gesture detection run in parallel
- **Modular code** - separate classes for game logic and gesture control
- **Event-driven** - gestures trigger game state changes

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
```
Error: Could not open webcam
```
- Ensure webcam is connected and not used by other applications
- Try changing camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `1` or `2`
- Check camera permissions in your OS settings

### Package Installation Issues
```
Failed to install package
```
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install packages individually: `pip install opencv-python`
- Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts

### Performance Issues
- **Low FPS**: Close other applications using the camera
- **Gesture lag**: Ensure good lighting and clear hand visibility
- **Game stuttering**: Lower the game resolution in `snake_game.py`

## Customization

### Adjust Gesture Sensitivity
In `gesture_controller.py`, modify:
```python
self.gesture_threshold = 0.05  # Lower = more sensitive
```

### Change Game Speed
In `snake_game.py`, modify:
```python
self.base_speed = 8      # Normal speed (FPS)
self.boost_speed = 15    # Boost speed (FPS)
```

### Modify Colors
In `snake_game.py`, change color constants:
```python
self.NOKIA_GREEN = (155, 188, 15)  # Snake body color
self.LIGHT_GREEN = (204, 255, 51)  # Snake head color
```

## Development

### Adding New Gestures
1. Extend `detect_gestures()` in `gesture_controller.py`
2. Add gesture recognition logic using MediaPipe landmarks
3. Return new gesture type in the function
4. Handle new gesture in `main.py` game loop

### Modifying Game Mechanics
1. Edit game logic in `snake_game.py`
2. Add new features to the `SnakeGame` class
3. Update the drawing methods for visual changes
